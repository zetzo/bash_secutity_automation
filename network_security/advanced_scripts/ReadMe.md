Connections.sh

This script installs and enables the necessary packages, including the ufw firewall and the fail2ban intrusion prevention tool. It then configures various advanced Linux network security mechanisms, including IP spoofing protection, SYN cookies, source address verification, and TCP SYN cookies.

The script also configures the ufw firewall to block all incoming connections by default and allow outgoing connections. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to your system and protect against potential threats.

Finally, the script enables and starts the fail2ban service, which can help to prevent brute-force attacks by banning IP addresses that have repeatedly failed to authenticate.

By using this script, you can automate the process of configuring advanced Linux network security mechanisms and improve the security of your systems.

2FA.sh

This script first checks if the google-authenticator command is available, which indicates that 2FA is installed. If 2FA is not installed, it uses the apt command to install it.

The script then checks if the PAM module for 2FA is configured for the SSH daemon by searching for the relevant line in the /etc/pam.d/sshd file. If the PAM module is not configured, it adds the necessary line to the file.

Next, the script checks if 2FA is enabled for the current user by searching for the relevant line in the user's .profile file. If 2FA is not enabled, it runs the google-authenticator command to configure
